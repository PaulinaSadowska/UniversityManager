# UniversityManager
Site which displays and allow to edit information about students, their grades and courses. In this project I used 
[jQuery 2.x](http://jquery.com/download/), 
[KnockoutJS 3.x](http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/index.html) and [mapping plugin](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/plugins-mapping.html).

The data is fetched from RESTful service which is available [HERE] (https://github.com/PaulinaSadowska/REST).
